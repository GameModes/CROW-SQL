        "Information for new Colab users before running the project: \\\n",
        "1. Colab uses Virtual Machines (VM) to run Python Scripts. You can activate one by pressing the Connect button right top corner. It is currently set on using Standard CPU and GPU and High Ram, but you can customize it if you want.\n",
        "2. In Colab you can Collapse and Extend cells to improve the viewablity. The next block contains 2 code cells of downloading the libraries. You can simply press the play icon if you hover over the \"2 cells hidden\" text to automatically run the code after one another without looking at the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Information about the project beforehand: \\\n",
        "1. After the Libraries cell block, you have the LLM Retrieval cell block. This block lets you choose whether you prefer to activate Gemini's (vertex_llm) and/or OpenAI's model (OpenAIllm). You need to read this code part a bit yourself to understand it properly. Like Gemini needs your account info to access Vertex models, while OpenAI uses a simple API key.\n",
        "2. After the LLM Retrieval cell block, you have the Database Connection cell block. This extracts the database files out of (in this case) Google cloud. Each database is stored together in a single variable using function \"extract_databases_from_gcs\". You can use either Bird-bench or Spider to benchmark the LLMs. (You can only use one to place in the variable \"test_databases\")\n",
        "3. After the Database Connection cell block, you have the Benchmarking cell block. Here you can configure the parameters for both the agents and the LLM (be careful to use correct wording for each benchmark). Afterwards each agent is configured (no need to change anything there if you don't want to) and some extra functions to properly deal with some data structures like in the \"Loading function\" cell. After that the \"running\" cell shows live how the process is ran. If you want to see what each agent thinks, you can turn on the \"verbose\" parameter in the configure agent function. Currently only the thinking process of the manager agent is turned on.\n",
        "4. During the running process of the \"running\" cell, after each database is finished its output is stored in the folder that is indicated by the variable \"output_folder\" (see cell after \"Benchmarking\" cell block) like \"bird-bench/benchmarks/senior_geminiv5/california_schools.json\". Currently this is stored within Google Cloud Console -> Buckets -> Dashboardllmbucket -> \"output folder\".\n",
        "5. The naming of the google cloud folders are based off the parameters. A name like \"refiner_geminiv3(5)\" uses All agents + Gemini + 3 Query amount + 5 Few shots. A name like \"senior_geminiv5\" uses Manager, Database and Senior agent + Gemini + 5 Query Amount.\n"

        "  - `tool_info_schema`: Shows table schema and sample rows.\n",

If an error is returned, rewrite the query, check the query, and try again. If you encounter an issue with Unknown column 'xxxx' in 'field list', use `info_sql_database_tool` to query the correct table fields\n",
        "\n",
        "  ## ❗ Do NOT misuse tools inside SQL queries\n",
        "  🚫 NEVER include tool names (e.g., `tool_list_tables`, `tool_info_schema`, `tool_run_query`) inside a SQL statement.\n",
        "  - They are NOT SQL functions.\n",
        "  - NEVER write `SELECT tool_list_tables()` or anything similar.\n",
        "  - These tools are **used before writing SQL** to gather information about the database structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ## External Knowledge\n",
        "  - Bonding/bonded also means connected\n",
        "  - When asked about an object that doesn't have an exact column about it (such as \"atoms\") try to use the ID column of it (like column atom_id from atom or atom_id from connected or atom_id2 from connected)\n",
        "  - When asked find object x from y which has object z, also mention object y in the SELECT column.\n",
        "  - When you hesitate between objects to SELECT, use all 2 or 3. Rather have too much information than less.\n",
        "  - Given a question/prompt with \"between\" place it in the query with the appropriate values. Like: Prompt:Among the molecules between TR004 to TR010, how many of them has single bonds? Answer: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T.molecule_id) FROM bond AS T WHERE T.molecule_id BETWEEN 'TR004' AND 'TR010' AND T.bond_type = '-'\n",
        "  - When given answers with a lot of NONE values, try to make a query that says to show no \"NONE\" or aren't null\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Before writing any SQL, ALWAYS first:\n",
        "    1. Use `tool_list_tables` to get the list of available tables.\n",
        "    2. Then use `tool_info_schema` on relevant tables to view columns and relationships.\n",
        "    3. Only after gathering table and schema info, generate valid SQL using actual table/column names.\n",

        "  - Before including any table in a SQL query, confirm its existence using `list_sql_database_tool`.\n",
        "  - If `query_sql_database_tool` returns an error indicating a table or column does not exist, use `info_sql_database_tool` to get the correct names and rewrite the query.\n",
        "  - When generating a query, follow these steps:\n",
        "      1. Use `list_sql_database_tool` to verify table existence.\n",
        "      2. If needed, use `info_sql_database_tool` to get table schema.\n",
        "      3. **Analyze the error messages from previous attempts to identify the specific tables and columns that caused errors. Avoid using these tables and columns in subsequent queries.**\n",
        "      4. Generate the SQL query using the error message information, and the schema information.\n",
        "      5. Use `query_sql_database_tool` to validate the query. If an error occurs, return to step 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ### **Tools Available**\n",
        "  Use the following tools as needed:\n",
        "  - `info_sql_database_tool`: Lists table names in the database.\n",
        "  - `query_sql_database_tool`: Execute SQL queries to valide. If the query is not correct, an error message will be returned. If an error is returned, rewrite the query, check the query, and try again. If you encounter an issue with Unknown column 'xxxx' in 'field list', use `info_sql_database_tool` to query the correct table fields\n",
        "\n",
        "  ### Abbreviation Handling\n",
        "  When you encounter abbreviations, follow these steps:\n",
        "  1.  Try to infer their full meaning from the surrounding context and the database schema.\n",
        "  2.  Pay close attention to column names and data types.\n",
        "  3.  Use the `info_sql_database_tool` to examine column data if needed.\n",
        "  4.  If unsure, reason about possible meanings based on the database context.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example: If the question is 'Find schools with CDSCode 12345' and the database has a 'schools' table with a 'CDSCode' column, the SQL query should be 'SELECT * FROM schools WHERE CDSCode = '12345';' because CDSCode is a school identifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ### **Refinement Process**\n",
        "  You will be provided with a list of bad SQL queries that failed to execute, along with their corresponding error messages in a dictionary. Your task is to analyze these errors and generate corrected SQL queries that don't have tables and columns that cause errors as provided in the error messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ### **Error Analysis**\n",
        "  Common SQL errors include:\n",
        "  - \"unknown column\": The column name is incorrect.\n",
        "  - \"syntax error\": The SQL syntax is invalid.\n",
        "  - \"table not found\": The table name is incorrect.\n",
        "  - \"ambiguous column name\": a column name is used that exist in multiple tables, and the table is not specified.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ### **Input Format**\n",
        "  You will a prompt that will indicate the question/prompt, the failed queries (and which tables were incorrect used) and the correct queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ### **Refinement Rules**\n",
        "  - **Thoroughly analyze the error messages to identify the specific tables and columns that caused the errors.**\n",
        "  - **Avoid using tables and columns that caused previous errors.**\n",
        "  - If the results contain lots of NONE values, try to find the column that caused it and make a WHERE clause that says \"is not null\" like \"CharterNum is not null\"\n",
        "  - Use the `info_sql_database_tool` to get the correct schema information.\n",
        "  - **Make significant changes to the original query to fix the error, avoiding the use of the tables and columns that caused previous errors.**\n",
        "  - **Ensure the corrected query is significantly different from all previous attempts.**\n",
        "  - Ensure the corrected query is valid against the database schema.\n",
        "  - Avoid using Where clauses with exactly the correct phrase, rather use \"LIKE '%word%'\" instead of  \"= 'word'\" and look at the possible values in the column rather than the question. Example prompt: How many unified schools? -> LIKE '%unified school%'\n",
